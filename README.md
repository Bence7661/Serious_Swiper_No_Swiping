# Swiper No Swiping
When you remove the PSU from an armor you the batteries in it are "refunded" if the power level is above 100 (because 100 stays on the suit).

## Features
If you have batteries in your inventory that are not 100% then the refunding process won't necessarily create new batteries.  
First it will look through your inventory and see if you have any batteries that it can "recharge" thus avoiding having 1000 batteries that are all below 100%

As Charlie would say:
